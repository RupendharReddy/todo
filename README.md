ToDo List Webapp
This web application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, or delete them. Completed tasks are stored separately for easy tracking, and the user can monitor their progress through a personalized profile.

Features:
    Task Management: Add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, or delete them.
    Completed Tasks: View completed tasks on a separate page.
    User Profile: Track user progress, including the number of tasks pending and completed. The profile displays the user's name.
    User Authentication: First-time users must register, and returning users can log in to their accounts securely.
Technologies Used:
    Frontend: React.js, CSS
    Backend: Node.js with Express
    Database: SQL
    Security: JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication

How It Works:
    Register: First-time users create an account by registering with their details.
    Login: Users log in using their credentials.
    Task Addition: Once logged in, users can add tasks to their dashboard.
    Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, moving them to the "Completed Tasks" page.
    User Profile: The profile page shows the number of pending and completed tasks, and the user's name.
